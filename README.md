# Popbots UNIVERSAL REST API  

# 1. To deploy:

## 1.1 Deploying given the database has been configured
- Create a python3.7 venv (see online tutorials) recommended name popbots_venv
- Activate the venv by doing: 
    > source "venv_name"/bin/activate
- install all the required packages by navigating into the popbots folder and running 
    > pip3 install -r requirements.txt

- Several environment variables are mandatory in order for the code to communicate with slack, telegram and the Postgres database (Contact the Administrator to obtain a file with all the neccessary env variables). Once you have the file:

    1. Copy all the environment variables in the ~/.bash_profile (they look like export VARNAME="something"), the bash_profile might not exist, just create it. 
        > sudo nano ~/.bash_profile 
    
    2. Source the newly created env variables 
        > source ~/.bash_profile 

## 1.2 Deploying the Postgres Database on your local machine (not mandatory)

- Install Postgres on your machine
- Create a Database user and password 
- Create a database with a corresponding name and password
- Edit the .ini file (in models/core/database.ini) and complete all fiels accordingly (if you are working on your local machine, host will be localhost) 
- Create the tables with the file models/core/create_tables.py
- I recommend using DBEAVER to view and monitor database (https://dbeaver.io/download/)

# 1.3 Running the code/telegram/slack sockets

If you are just testing you can just run the python or telegram script like so:
- Activate the venv by doing: 
    > source "venv_name"/bin/activate
- Run the code
    > python3 telegram_socket.py
    or
    > python3 slack_socket.py

In deployment we will use PM2 as a process manager, for logs and also restarting the APP in case it crashes

- For installation (see instructions here : https://blog.pm2.io/2018-09-19/Manage-Python-Processes/)

# 2. Code documentation

## 2.1. Project structure 

### 2.1.1. (REST API)

Popbots API is structured as follow (see image below). As much as possible it follow the REST API guidelines (here routers are controllers) 
![Schema Project Structure](./documentation/images/PopbotsAPI_structure.png)

### 2.1.2. Database Structure (as of 03/22/2020)


### ER (Entity Relation) Diagram
![Schema Database](./documentation/images/database_schematics.png)


The database design is centered on the user, users can be Humans or Bot. This design may allow in the future direct conversation with human if needed. 

Users if they are human have some more properties references in the table human_users

To make authoring the bots scripts convienient, each bot has a 0-N index. This arbitraly given numbers are limiting the use of normal key-pair relationships since these requires unique ids. This explains why there is no relationships between next_message_finders and content_finders



## 2.2. Functionnality descriptions

### 2.2.1. Intent/Selector process 

Intents and outbound_intents (selectors) solves a major problem when trying to build a chatbot with user's freedom in the response and branching tree. 
Most system (DialogFlow, Rasabots etc) rely only "on one to many index tables" and intent for each of the next index. Our system also use those, but there is an additional layer of verification. outbound_intents (selectors) are given to prevent error while authoring.

A typical bot script may look like this :

```
Hi {user}, are you happy ? (bot expect yes or no)

if: user say yes --> Good, it is nice to feel happy.

else: user say no --> Sorry to hear that, I am here to help.
```
In this given scenario, the bot script table look like this:


|index|bot_message|intent|selector|
|---|---|---|---|
|0|Hi {user.name}, are you happy ?|none|yes?no|
|1|Good, it is nice to feel happy.|yes|none|
|2|Sorry to hear that, I am here to help|no|none|

To this table we need a one to many correspondance table

|index|next_index|
|---|---|
|1|2|
|1|3|

Here for message index (1) there is two next possible indexes (2,3).

Given the selector of yes?no for message (1) we will parse the user message and look for a positive or negative answer we will extract one intent (Extracted Intent)

Base on the **Extracted intent** we will select the good response between (2,3)

![Selector Feature Schematics](./documentation/images/selector_feature_process.png)


### 2.2.2. outbound_intents (Selector)

outbound_intents define at index x what are the expected intents at indexes x+1
Reminder: We introduce the concept of outbound_intents to make sure that inputting as been correctly done. 

Typical outbound_intents are as follow:

* outbound_intent follow a rigorous pattern: condition1/condition2. For 3 branches it follows the pattern condition1/condition2?condition3.  For x conditions condition1/condition2/condition3/â€¦/conditionX 
* By engineering design there is no deadlock right now, meaning there is always an alternative given by the intent 'alternative'. 

The develloper can create special outbound_intents in order to perform a custom selection process. 

These are outbound_intents with the "@" tag in the beggining. 

Example:

Here is a function which return condition (yes) if the word count in the user message (input_string ) is greater than a particular word count : 

```python 
def min_word(input_string,word_len,condition,alternative):
    
    if len(word_tokenize(input_string))>word_len: #word_tokenize function is provided by nltk
        return condition,[condition,alternative]
    else:
        return alternative,[condition,alternative]
```
This function can be called via a outbound_intent named @min_word(input_string,4,"yes","no"), this call for instance will return yes if the word count is greater than 4 or no reversely


**/!\ Caution:** If 





## 2.3 Bot Authoring/inputting Process

Here is a diagram of what the overall Authoring Process looks like. 

![Bot Authoring process](./documentation/images/authoring_process.png)



/!\ This must be done with rigor! Not following the naming pattern, leaving an empty cell, etc will break the bot and might break the python code as well. 

Filling content

Rules: 

- A bot conversation should always start with <START> flag and Finish with <CONVERSATION_END>
- The START flag must always be at index 0
- All the columns must be filled ( no NA is accepted) 
- No content must be added outside of the given columns ( such as comments). - - Comments are ok but using the google sheet "Comments"

Line Breaks:

If you want the message to be split in multiple messages on Telegram or Slack. You can create multiple indexes(message 1, 2, 3). If you have simple back to back messages can include "\n"  in the message where the line break needs to happen in the text. 

Dynamic Variables:

Dynamic variables can be added to the text wrapped in curly brackets {} (ex: Hi {user.name}). 

**/!\ Caution:** The name of the variable needs to map exactly what is declared in the python code. A list of possibilities will be provided. New variables need to be discussed with 
the development team. 

|user.name|
|---|
|bot_user.name|
|conversation.stressor|
|stressor.probability0|


Images:

Images can be also added directly in that file. By including in the bot text the name of the image file wrapped with the wrapper $img$ (ex: $img$IMAGE_NAME$img$ )

**/!\ Caution:** images format needs to be png (ex: IMAGE_NAME.png). Furthermore, this image needs to be uploaded to the server. There is no automatic way to do this for the moment, you must inform the platform administrator. 



### Pushing the bots to the database

A python script needs to be run on the server in order to populate the popbots database.  

To do this: 

--ONLY ONCE Steps-- 
1. Contact the "system administrator" to obtain the [AWS_CREDENTIALS] file. 
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where [AWS_CREDENTIALS] is.
3. Grant permission to the [AWS_CREDENTIALS]
> chmod 400 [AWS_CREDENTIALS].pem

--ONLY ONCE Steps--

5. Ssh into the remote server

> ssh -i "[AWS_CREDENTIALS].pem" [USER_NAME]@ec2-3-21-127-11.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com

6. Navigate to /opt/Popbots directory

> cd /opt/Popbots/
7. Activate the popbots virtual environment
> source ../popbots_venv/bin/activate

8. Finally, run the populate_database_live.py script

> python populate_database_live.py

You will see terminal logs to indicate if the operation was successfull.
